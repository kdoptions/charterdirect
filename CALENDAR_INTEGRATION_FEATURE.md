# 🗓️ Google Calendar Integration During Boat Listing

## ✨ **New Feature: Calendar Selection During Boat Setup**

Boat owners can now connect their Google Calendar and select which calendar to use for each boat **while they're setting up their listing**. This creates a seamless experience where calendar integration happens right when it's needed.

## 🎯 **What This Feature Does:**

### **1. Calendar Connection Status**
- Shows whether the owner has already connected their Google Calendar
- Displays connection status (Connected/Not Connected)
- Provides a "Connect Google Calendar" button if not connected

### **2. Calendar Selection**
- Lists all available Google Calendars
- Allows selection of specific calendar for the boat
- Shows calendar names and primary status
- Includes calendar color selection

### **3. Integration Toggle**
- Enable/disable calendar integration per boat
- Prevents accidental calendar sync
- Only works when calendar is connected

## 🚀 **How It Works:**

### **For Users Already Connected:**
1. **Navigate** to boat listing → Step 2 (Pricing & Availability)
2. **See** calendar integration section below availability blocks
3. **Toggle** "Enable Calendar Integration" to ON
4. **Select** which calendar to use from dropdown
5. **Choose** event color for calendar events
6. **Continue** with boat listing process

### **For Users Not Connected:**
1. **Navigate** to boat listing → Step 2 (Pricing & Availability)
2. **See** "Not Connected" status in calendar section
3. **Click** "Connect Google Calendar" button

5. **Return** to boat listing with calendar connected
6. **Follow** steps above for connected users

## 📍 **Where It's Located:**

- `calendar_integration_enabled` - Whether integration is active

### **Database Setup:**
